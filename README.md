## Hi there 👋

My name is **Ziyi Yang (杨子逸)**. You can call me Ziyi.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning at Sun Yat-sen University as a second-year MS student (expected to graduate in 2026), advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan/). Before this, I received my Bachelor's degree (2019-2023, computer science and technology) from Sun Yat-sen University. I am currently an intern at Alibaba Tongyi (2025.05-now).
- 🤔  My primary research interests lie at the intersection of several key areas in modern artificial intelligence. These include heterogeneous model fusion, with a focus on integrating diverse large language models (LLMs); advanced preference learning algorithms such as DPO and SimPO; the development of large reasoning models (LRMs) capable of adaptive thinking; and novel reinforcement learning (RL) methodologies, particularly in long-context and self-play scenarios. My representative publications are listed below.
