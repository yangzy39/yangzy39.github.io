## Hi there 👋

My name is **Ziyi Yang (杨子逸)**. You can call me Ziyi.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning at Sun Yat-sen University as a third-year MS student (expected to graduate in 2026), advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan/). Before this, I received my Bachelor's degree (2019-2023, computer science and technology) from Sun Yat-sen University. I am currently an intern at Tongyi Lab, Alibaba Group (2025.05-now).
- 🤔 My primary research interests lie at several key areas in LLM post-training. These include heterogeneous model fusion, with a focus on integrating diverse LLMs into a stronger one; advanced preference learning algorithms such as DPO and SimPO; the development of large reasoning models (LRMs) capable of adaptive thinking; and novel reinforcement learning (RL) methodologies, particularly in long-context reasoning and mutli-agent self-play scenarios. My representative publications are listed below.
