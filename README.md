## Hi there 👋


Here are some ideas to get you started:
My name is **Ziyi Yang (杨子逸)**. You can call me Ziyi.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning at Sun Yat-sen University as a second-year MS student (expected to graduate in 2026), advised by [Prof. Xiaojun Quan](https://sites.google.com/site/xiaojunquan/). Before this, I received my Bachelor's degree (2019-2023, computer science and technology) from Sun Yat-sen University.
- 🤔 My main research interests focus on heterogeneous **model fusion** (e.g., combining the strengths of multiple large language models (LLMs) with diverse structures/scales), **preference optimization** algorithm (e.g., DPO, SimPO), and large reasoning models (LRMs) (e.g., efficient reasoning, RL scaling, Self-Play Agent RL).
